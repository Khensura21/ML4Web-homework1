# Introduction:
For this assignment we were to build on top of the class example which was using the MobileNet model to classify objects via our webcams.

# Inspiration
After seeing the highly-anticipated horror film, "US", I became hooked on the remixed version of the classic Hip Hop song, "I Got Five On It, by Luniz. I was literally jamming to the song almost everyday, so I decided to pay homage to the film's soundtrack in my assignment.

# What I Did
Using the MobileNet Model, I determined that upon recognizing a $5 bill, the sketch would:
1. Commence playing the legendary song, "I Got Five On It"
2. Display some dope cover art of the Artist Group, Luniz, who created the song.



# Before 
Here is how my sketched look before identifying a five dollar bill:

# After 
After recognizing the 5 dollar bill, it triggered this change:

# Reflection
Even after this relative simple exercise, I can see why the hype around Machine Learning is very big. This project alone has gotten me very excited about the many applications that can possibly incorporate this techonology to make it more robust. I look forward to building more cool , fun, and helpful applications in this course!
